### Description

Two groups of female rats were exposed to the carcinogen DMBA.  The two groups differed with respect to a pretreatment regime (unfortunately, no further detail was provided in the original paper).  The purpose of the study was to determine whether the course of the disease, as measured by the time until death from vaginal cancer, differed by group.

### Variables

* `Group`: Experimental group (0, 1)
* `Time`: Time on study (days)
* `Death`: Death indicator (1=death, 0=censored)
