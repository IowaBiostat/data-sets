    <h3 id="description">Description</h3>
    <p>This data comes from one of the earliest randomized clinical trials of a chemotherapuetic agent, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP). The trial was conducted across 11 American hospitals, and involved children with acute leukemia that experienced a complete or partial remission (i.e, all/most of the signs of the disease had disappeared) of their leukemia following treatment with the drug prednisone. The trial was conducted by matching pairs of patients at a given hospital by remission status (complete or partial) and randomizing within the pair to either a 6-MP or placebo. Patients were followed until their leukemia returned (relapse) or until the end of the study.</p>
