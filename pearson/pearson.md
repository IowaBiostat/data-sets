Data from the famous historical study of Karl Pearson on the heritability of height.  Karl Pearson, one of the pioneers of 20th century statistics, measured the heights of 1078 fathers and their fully grown sons.

Pearson's original data was measured and reported to the nearest inch.  This data set has had a small amount of random uniform noise added to it to render it continuous.
