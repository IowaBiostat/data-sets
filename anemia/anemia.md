## Survival and GVHD in aplastic anemia patients receiving marrow transplantation

### Description

Aplastic anemia is a condition in which the bone marrow produces an insufficient number of new blood cells.  In this study, patients with severe aplastic anemia were given a bone marrow transplant from a compatible family member and followed to track the occurrence of survival and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).  GVHD is a common complication of bone marrow transplantation in which the immune cells produced by the new bone marrow recognize the recipient as a foreign body and mount an attack.  To ward off GVHD, the recipients received one of two drug combinations: methotrexate (MTX) or methotrexate plus cyclosporine (MTX+CSP).  The goal of the study is to determine whether treatment affected the occurrence of GVHD as well as its impact on survival.
