### Description

Aplastic anemia is a condition in which the bone marrow produces an insufficient number of new blood cells.  In this study, patients with severe aplastic anemia were given a bone marrow transplant from a compatible family member and followed to track the occurrence of survival and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).  GVHD is a common complication of bone marrow transplantation in which the immune cells produced by the new bone marrow recognize the recipient as a foreign body and mount an attack.  To ward off GVHD, the recipients received one of two drug combinations: methotrexate (MTX) or methotrexate plus cyclosporine (MTX+CSP).  The goal of the study is to determine whether treatment affected the occurrence of GVHD as well as its impact on survival.

### Variables

* `Trt`: Treatment group (MTX, MTX+CSP)
* `Time_gvhd`: Time on study with respect to GVHD (days)
* `Status_gvhd`: Event indicator for GVHD (1=GVHD, 0=No observed GVHD while on study)
* `Time`: Time on study with respect to survival (days)
* `Status`: Event indicator for GVHD (1=Died, 0=Death not observed during study)
