### Description

The British Doctors' Study was the first large prospective cohort study to examine the health consequences of smoking.  In 1951, British doctors were sent a brief questionnaire about whether they smoked tobacco. Since then, information about their deaths has been collected.  This data set records the number of deaths and person-years of follow-up in various categories 10 years after the initial questionnaire was sent out.
