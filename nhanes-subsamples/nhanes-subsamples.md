### Description

Each column of the data set contains 1,000 sample means of triglyceride levels calculated from 1,000 randomly drawn subsamples of the full NHANES data set `lipids`.  For each column, however, the number of women in those subsamples was different.

This is not a real data set and is intended solely for the academic purpose of teaching about sampling distributions.

### Variables

* `A`: Mean triglyceride levels in random samples (mg/dL), sample size = ?
* `B`: Mean triglyceride levels in random samples (mg/dL), sample size = ?
* `C`: Mean triglyceride levels in random samples (mg/dL), sample size = ?

### Reference

See the `lipids` data.
