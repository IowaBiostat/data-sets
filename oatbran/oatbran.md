### Description

A crossover study was conducted to investigate whether oat bran cereal helps to lower serum cholesterol levels.  Fourteen male individuals with high cholesterol were randomly placed on a diet that included either oat bran or corn flakes; after two weeks, their LDL cholesterol levels were measured.  Each individual was then switched to the other diet; after two weeks, the LDL levels were recorded again.

In the data set, each row corresponds to one of the 14 individuals in the trial.

### Variables

* `CornFlakes`: The individual's LDL level at the end of his time on the corn flake diet (mmol/l)
* `OatBran`: The individual's LDL level at the end of his time on the oat bran diet (mmol/l)
