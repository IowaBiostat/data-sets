### Description

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program of studies designed and carried out by the National Center for Health Statistics to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States.  Since 1999, the survey has been carried out on a biennial basis (i.e., every two years).
