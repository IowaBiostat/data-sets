# Data set collection

This repository hosts data sets intended to be used for teaching or illustrating methods on real data.

(in-progress)

## Contributing

1. Create a folder with the title of your data set (`lead_iq`).
2. Provide a description of the data set. These must be written in markdown and should follow the format in `bin/template.md` (`lead_iq.md`).
3. Provide the data, preferably in a non-proprietary format such as delimited plain text (`lead_iq.txt`).

You must include a markdown file and a raw data file, and they must have the same name as the folder. If you include additional files (e.g., preprocessing code), they will appear on the repository but will not appear on the website.

Please try to provide a helpful and informative description. A poorly documented example data set is not very useful.
