### Description

Two groups of male mice were given 300 rads of radiation and and tracked until death for instances of cancer.  One group was maintained in a germ-free environment; a control group was maintained a standard lab environment.  The cause of death is recorded for all mice.  In particular, it is worth noting that not all mice died of cancer.

### Variables

* `Group`: Experimental group (Control, Germ-free)
* `Cause`: Cause of death (Thymic lymphoma, Reticulum cell sarcoma, Other)
* `Time`: Time of death (days)
